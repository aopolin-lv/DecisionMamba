This work presents Decision Mamba (DM), a novel multi-grained state space model (SSM) with a self-evolving policy learning strategy. DM explicitly models the historical hidden state to extract the temporal information by using the mamba architecture. To capture the relationship among state-action-RTG triplets, a fine-grained SSM module is designed and integrated into the original coarse-grained SSM in mamba, resulting in a novel mamba architecture tailored for offline RL. Finally, to mitigate the overfitting issue on noisy trajectories, a self-evolving policy is proposed by using progressive regularization. The policy evolves by using its own past knowledge to refine the suboptimal actions, thus enhancing its robustness on noisy demonstrations.

## Usage 

### Installation
#### 1. Install MuJoCo
First, you need to download the file from this [link](https://mujoco.org/download/mujoco210-linux-x86_64.tar.gz) and `tar -xvf the_file_name` in the `~/.mujoco` folder. Then, run the following commands.
```bash
cd experiment-d4rl
conda env create -f env.yml
```
After that, add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` file:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/YOUR_PATH_TO_THIS/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/nvidia
```
Remember to `source ~/.bashrc` to make the changes take effect.

#### 2. Install D4RL
Install D4RL by following the guidance in [D4RL](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/D4RL).

#### 3. Dataset
To download original D4RL data, 
```bash
cd data
python download_d4rl_datasets.py
```

### Run
```
sh run.sh hopper medium 0 0.85
```
